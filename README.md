### Running the Script

You can run the Script by adding the *Scriptable Auto Splitter* component to your Layout. Right-click on LiveSplit and choose "Edit Layout..." to open the Layout Editor, then click on the Plus-sign and choose "Scriptable Auto Splitter" from the section "Control". You can set the Path of the Script by going into the component settings of the Scriptable Auto Splitter. To get to the settings of the component you can either double click it in the Layout Editor or go into to the Scriptable Auto Splitter Tab of the Layout Settings. Once you've set the Path, the script should automatically load and hopefully work. (Excerpt from https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md)
